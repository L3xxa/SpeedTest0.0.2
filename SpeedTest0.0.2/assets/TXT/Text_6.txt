A sailor stood on the deck, staring at the vast ocean. The waves rocked the 
ship gently, and the salty breeze filled the air. The sun was setting, creating a 
golden path across the water. He thought about the people he had left behind, 
wondering when he would see them again. The sea was beautiful, but his heart 
longed for home.
