A young boy sat on the porch, watching the storm roll in. Dark clouds
covered the sky, and thunder rumbled in the distance. The wind grew
stronger, making the trees sway wildly. Then, the first raindrop landed
on his cheek. Moments later, the sky opened, pouring heavy rain. He laughed
and ran into the yard, enjoying the cool water on his skin.
