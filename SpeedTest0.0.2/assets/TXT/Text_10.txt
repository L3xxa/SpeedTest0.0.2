In a small village by the sea, an old fisherman prepared his boat for the
morning. He checked the nets, making sure they were strong. The tide was
calm, and the stars above reflected on the water. He took a deep breath,
enjoying the salty air. Fishing had been his life for decades, and even now,
he loved the peaceful rhythm of the waves.
