The city lights sparkled like stars as she walked along the busy streets. Cars 
honked, music played from nearby restaurants, and laughter echoed through 
the air. She passed a street artist painting a breathtaking portrait. For a 
moment, she stopped and admired his work, wondering about the stories 
behind each stroke of color.
